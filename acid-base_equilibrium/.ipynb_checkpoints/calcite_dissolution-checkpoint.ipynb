    "### Use of the command REACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add calcite in a series of steps to the solution and see the changes for each step. For this we use the REACTION command. This is the first example of a simple reaction path calculation. A reaction path model uses speciation calculations to make forward predictions of changes in water and rock (dissolution/precipitation) along a reaction path (specified change in T, P, pH, new reactants).\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows a conceptual diagram where the system can be altered by adding or subtracting mass of heat, or composition or controlled by contact with another reservoir that buffers change. Reaction path models operate by first calculating the equilibrium condition of the specified system, then the program changes the condition (e.g. temperature, composition) by a small increment and calculates the new equilibrium condition. Then the next step uses the last step as the starting point until the end of the path is reached. In the example below, the increments along the reaction path are specified. A good way to visualize this is the addition of base to a solution (titration) to change the initial acidic pH of 2 to a value of 12 with a calculation made for each drop of acid added. During the process, the solution may have minerals precipitate or dissolve, gas content increase or decrease, etc. This method is used to model many real world processes of interest such as mixing of fluids, dissolution of minerals, changes in temperature, Eh, pH, fugacity or concentration of a particular species. PHREEQC differs from other reaction path models such as Geochemist’s Workbench and EQ6 in that does not automatically allow mineral precipitation and dissolution along the reaction path unless specified and then only those minerals specified by the user.\n",

In this example we have named the output file ‘N1dout.csv’; the suffix means comma-separated-values. This command allows us to manage the large amount of data that is generated by multiple simulations. The output file still contains the complete output of each simulation. The command is discussed in more detail below. We can also start to use the grid function in PHREEQC. This function allows us to view and plot the data in the selected output file from within the PHREEQC shell. This command creates a comma-separated value (CSV) file named N1dout.csv that can be opened using the Grid tab.\n",

    "This following simulation adds calcite to pure water and reaches saturatio; the addition of 0.1 moles to the 1 kg of solution completely saturates the solution. The second step adds 0.2 moles of calcite (20 g) to a different 1 kg of solution and so on, in effect making 10 different simulations. Sometimes you want to add increments of a reactant to the same solution. In that case, use the INCREMENTAL_REACTIONS command rather than REACTION. An example is considered below.\n",

    "First, graph the results of the REACTION simulation after you add the subcommand saturation_indices line to the SELECTED_OUTPUT command block. Use the input menu to add the command by clicking on the plus by the SELECTED_OUTPUT command on the right hand side of the window and by double-clicking on the term. This will insert the term into the input file wherever the cursor is located. We can see that we have reached saturation with respect to Calcite very quickly.\n",

    "Suppose you want to approach saturation more slowly simulating a titration and watch the change in pH as you add Calcite in increments to a single solution. You can first reduce the amount of calcite added by changing the numbers specifying the amounts added or by changing the units. For instance, we can and reduce the amount of calcite by making the input mmoles rather than moles (the default).\n",
