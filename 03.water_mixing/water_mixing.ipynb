    "## Water mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "In aqueous geochemistry, there are many situations where different waters mix. In these practices, we will study examples such as seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers and the mixing of surface waters (rivers, lakes, etc.). The mixing process between two different waters will create a disequilibrium in the resulting water, potentially triggering modifying processes (e.g., precipitation or dissolution of calcite, sulfate reduction, etc.). The variation in concentration after mixing (ionic deltas) will be key to evaluating the conservative nature of the element in the mix and assessing any modifying processes that occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practice, we will address at least the following geochemical problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Development of karst systems in coastal limestone aquifers due to seawater intrusion.\n",
    "Dissolution-precipitation and neutralization reactions in the resulting water.\n",
    "Quantification of mixing processes in a conservative manner.\n",
    "Determination of water mixing proportions using conservative elements: Cl⁻.\n",
    "All these combinations are built from a template similar to the one used for Speciating Natural Water, but with the keyword MIX. The input file structure consists of three parts: the characteristics of the first and second waters to be mixed, and the mixing fraction of these waters. In other words:\n",

    "*Coastal Karstification* refers to the process of coastal karstification, which is the chemical weathering and dissolution of carbonate rocks (like limestone) along coastal areas. This results in the formation of features such as sinkholes, caves, and underground channels due to the action of slightly acidic water, often from rain or seawater mixing with fresh groundwater. Coastal karst systems are highly sensitive to changes in water chemistry, especially when influenced by nearby seawater.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Contamination by seawater intrusion*, occurs when seawater infiltrates freshwater aquifers, typically due to over-extraction of groundwater near coastlines. This intrusion raises the salinity of the groundwater, affecting water quality and making it less suitable for drinking, agriculture, and industry. Seawater intrusion can also alter the geochemical environment, potentially leading to the dissolution or precipitation of minerals within the aquifer."
