    "In this practice, we will add or remove a phase from a solution using the `REACTION` keyword. This allows us to add solid species (e.g., calcite), dissolved species (e.g., H₂O, NaCl), and/or gaseous species (e.g., CO₂(g), O₂(g)). For gases, in particular, the moles can be related to their partial pressure using Henry's Law.\n",

    "- Evolution of water characteristics by adding a substance: neutralization of acidic water, pyrite oxidation, etc.\n",
    "- Variation in the solubility of a mineral by increasing ion concentration (common ion effect).\n",
    "- Stability of minerals with different degrees of hydration (e.g., gypsum-anhydrite) based on ionic strength variation: role of water activity.\n",
