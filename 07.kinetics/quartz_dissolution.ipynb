    "PHREEQC can model kinetic reactions of any type in a perfectly general and flexible manner.\n",
    "Kinetic reaction rates are defined with keyword RATES in the form of BASIC programs. The rates are called with keyword KINETICS, which defines the time steps, the chemical formula of the reactant, and parameters that are used in the rate.\n",
    "BASIC programs consist of numbered lines with statements that resemble the formula in a spreadsheet cell. Special functions give access to the chemical variables of PHREEQC. These functions are described in the PHREEQC manual in \"The Basic interpreter\", Table 8.\n",
